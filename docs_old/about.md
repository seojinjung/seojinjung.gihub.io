# About
My name is Seojin Jung (they/them), and I am a recent graduate from [Amherst College][https://www.amherst.edu/] (2024), where I studied biology and computer science. As an undergrad, I worked in the [Blanchard lab][https://jeffreyblanchard.github.io/lab/] at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst][https://www.umass.edu/], where, for my honors thesis in biology, I analyzed the metagenomic data of soil-dwelling bacterial decomposers from Harvard Forest to determine how they have changed in response to long-term warming. 

My research interests are fairly broad at the moment, but I generally gravitate toward topics in computational biology, bioinformatics, microbiology, and genetics/genomics. Outside of research, I enjoy learning about entomology and medical history, among other things. I also like to draw, crochet, knit,  and cook.
