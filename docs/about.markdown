# About
My name is Seojin Jung (they/them), and I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Biology and Computer Science at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/). As an undergrad, my research interests are fairly broad, but I have found myself gravitating toward microbiology, computational biology, and genetics, which are all topics encompassed by my senior thesis (details below). Outside of research, I enjoy learning about entomology and medical history, among other things. I also like to draw, crochet, knit, and cook.

## Undergraduate thesis
I'm doing my biology undergraduate thesis with the [Blanchard lab][https://jeffreyblanchard.github.io/lab/] at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I'm analyzing the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data of soil-dwelling bacterial decomposers from Harvard Forest to determine how they have changed in response to long-term warming.
